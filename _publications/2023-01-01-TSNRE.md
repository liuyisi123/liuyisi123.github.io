Abstract
==========
**Background**
Epilepsy prediction algorithms offer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy a way to reduce unintended harm from sudden seizures. The purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of transfer learning (TL) technique and model inputs for different deep learning (DL) model structures, which may provide a reference for researchers to design algorithms. Moreover, we also attempt to provide a novel and precise Transformer-based algorithm. 

**Methods**
Two classical feature engineering methods and the proposed method which consists of various EEG rhythms are explored, then a hybrid Transformer model is designed to evaluate the advantages over pure convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models. Finally, the performances of two model structures are analyzed utilizing patient-independent approach and two TL strategies. 

**Results**
We tested our method on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database, the results showed that our feature engineering method gains a significant improvement in model performance and is more suitable for Transformer-based model. In addition, the performance improvement of Transformer-based model utilizing fine-tuning strategies is more robust than that of pure CNN-based model, and our model achieved an optimal sensitivity of 91.7% with false positive rate (FPR) of 0.00/h. Conclusion: Our epilepsy prediction method achieves excellent performance and demonstrates its advantage over pure CNN-based structure in TL. Moreover, we find that the information contained in the gamma ( γ ) rhythm is helpful for epilepsy prediction.

**Conclusions**
We propose a precise hybrid Transformer model for epilepsy prediction. The applicability of TL and model inputs is also explored for customizing personalized models in clinical application scenarios.
