Abstract
==========
**Background**
Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global health challenge, necessitating precise and continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and cardiac function. Traditional non-invasive measurement techniques often present operational complexities and discomfort, while photoplethysmography (PPG) technology lacks the ability to capture comprehensive hemodynamic parameters.

**Methods**
Herein, we introduce an innovative Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for personalized hemodynamic assessment, driven by advanced flexible sensing technologies and multi-scale modeling. Specifically, we propose a pulse wave detection system utilizing micro-fiber Bragg grating (lFBG) sensors for comprehensive spatiotemporal monitoring.

**Results**
The system leverages a Multi-scale Perception Network (MSP-Net) to achieve precise BP estimation, with mean errors (ME) and standard deviations (SD) of -0.05 ± 2.15 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and -0.19 ± 3.48 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The system’s performance surpasses traditional PPG-based methods across multiple hemodynamic parameters. Leveraging pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, this study realizes personalized estimation models, furnishing technical support for precision medicine. Furthermore, we utilize a cloud-edge collaborative framework to achieve hemodynamic assessment across multiple IoMT devices via LAN and the RV1126 platform, providing real-time feedback, thereby establishing a closed-loop control system.

**Conclusions**
Our study presents an innovative approach for the comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular function and the realization of personalized medicine, potentially serving as a promising solution for Healthcare 5.0 applications.
