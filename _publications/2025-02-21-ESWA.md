Abstract
==========
**Background**
Given the inadequacy of research in the realm of quality assessment (QA) for multimodal physiological signals, the current reliance on coarse-grained assessment based solely on unimodal signals has become manifestly insufficient. Within the domain of wearable devices, there is a particularly pressing need for refined QA results pertaining to multimodal physiological signals. This paper endeavors to introduce a real-time multimodal fine-grained QA algorithm and, through real-time application demonstrations, showcase its efficacy.

**Methods**
We have devised an attention network capable of simulating localized to global dependency relationships. By training individually, a corresponding QA model is assigned to each pattern. Fine-grained labels for the signals are allocated through weakly supervised learning. The proposed lightweight model has undergone systematic deployment, accompanied by the development of an interactive interface. 

**Results**
The experiments indicate that the proposed fine-grained QA exhibits intuitive consistency with evaluations by human experts. Tests conducted on a mixed database demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the algorithm has been deployed and integrated into practical applications, yielding outstanding results on self-constructed data. This study introduces a real-time multimodal fine-grained QA algorithm that exhibits a high level of visual consistency comparable to human experts, thereby enhancing the performance of multimodal information derivation tasks.

**Conclusions**
The proposed system achieves real-time visualization in real-world environments, offering clinical experts a high-quality reference granularity for multimodal information.
