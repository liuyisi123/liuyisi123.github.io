Abstract
==========
**Background**
The proliferation of wearable devices has escalated the standards for photoplethysmography (PPG) signal quality. This study introduces a lightweight model to address the imperative need for precise, real-time evaluation of PPG signal quality, followed by its deployment and validation utilizing our integrated upper computer and hardware system.

**Methods**
Multiscale Markov Transition Fields (MMTF) are employed to enrich the morphological information of the signals, serving as the input for our proposed hybrid model (HM). HM undergoes initial pre-training utilizing the MIMIC-III and UCI databases, followed by fine-tuning the Queensland dataset. Knowledge distillation (KD) then transfers the large-parameter model's knowledge to the lightweight hybrid model (LHM). LHM is subsequently deployed on the upper computer for real-time signal quality assessment. 

**Results**
HM achieves impressive accuracies of 99.1% and 96.0% for binary and ternary classification, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. LHM, with only 0.2 M parameters (0.44% of HM), maintains high accuracy despite a 2.6% drop. It achieves an inference speed of 0.023 s per image, meeting real-time display requirements. Furthermore, LHM attains a 97.7% accuracy on a self-created database. HM outperforms current methods in PPG signal quality accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, LHM substantially reduces parameter count while maintaining high accuracy, enhancing efficiency and practicality for real-time applications.

**Conclusions**
The proposed methodology demonstrates the capability to achieve high-precision and real-time assessment of PPG signal quality, and its practical validation has been successfully conducted during deployment. Significance: This study contributes a convenient and accurate solution for the real-time evaluation of PPG signals, offering extensive application potential.
