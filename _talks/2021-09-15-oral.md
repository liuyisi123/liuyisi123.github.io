In medical clinics, oscillometric automated sphygmomanometers are widely used. However, few studies have examined how the stability of oscillometric pulse waveforms affects BP accuracy. This study focuses on this issue. Cuff pressure signals were measured during the slow deflation phase from 20 healthy subjects under two conditions: quiet and still, and while moving their fingers. Oscillometric pulse waveforms were extracted from the cuff signals, and a second-order Gaussian model was used to fit the waveform peaks. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the fitted curve and the pulse amplitudes was calculated to assess waveform smoothness. Results showed that finger movement increased the RMSE by 0.28 mmHg. It also caused a significant increase in systolic BP (SBP) by 7.2 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) by 9.2 mmHg (both P<0.01). This study demonstrates that not staying still during measurement can significantly impact BP accuracy and waveform stabilit
