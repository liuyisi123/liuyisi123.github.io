## **🎤 Talk Overview:**

In **medical clinics**, oscillometric automated sphygmomanometers are widely used for blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, few studies have examined how the **stability of oscillometric pulse waveforms** affects BP accuracy. This study specifically investigates this issue.

---

## **🔬 Research Focus:**
Cuff pressure signals were measured during the **slow deflation phase** from 20 healthy subjects under two conditions:
1. **Quiet and still**
2. **While moving their fingers**

Oscillometric pulse waveforms were extracted from the cuff signals, and a **second-order Gaussian model** was used to fit the waveform peaks.

---

## **📊 Methodology:**
- **Waveform Smoothness**: The **root mean square error (RMSE)** between the fitted curve and the pulse amplitudes was calculated to assess waveform smoothness.
- **Results**:  
   - Finger movement increased the RMSE by **0.28 mmHg**.
   - It also caused a significant increase in:
     - **Systolic BP (SBP)**: Increased by **7.2 mmHg** (P < 0.01).
     - **Diastolic BP (DBP)**: Increased by **9.2 mmHg** (P < 0.01).

---

## **📝 Key Takeaway:**
This study demonstrates that **not staying still during BP measurement** can significantly impact **BP accuracy** and **waveform stability**. Movement introduces notable errors that can skew the results.
