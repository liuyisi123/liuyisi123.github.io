    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Research Hub!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Jian, a PhD student at <strong>Fudan University</strong>. My research interests lie in cloud-edge collaborative multimodal information fusion, specifically applied to personalized physiological parameter assessment. I specialize in wearable electronics, deep learning, model lightweighting, and the integration of edge and cloud computing technologies.</p>
